<p>
  The rapid evolution of 3D graphics has redefined workflows in gaming,
  engineering, education, and design. This thesis introduces a versatile 3D
  model viewer and renderer built using OpenGL and Assimp. The application
  supports multiple 3D file formats, provides real-time transformations such as
  rotation, scaling, and translation, and is designed for cross-platform
  compatibility. The work includes a detailed performance evaluation to ensure
  robustness and scalability under various conditions, offering a reliable and
  interactive visualization tool for static 3D models.
