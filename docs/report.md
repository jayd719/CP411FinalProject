## Development of a Versatile 3D Model Viewer and Renderer Using OpenGL and Assimp


### Abstract
The rapid evolution of 3D graphics has redefined workflows in gaming, engineering, education, and design. This thesis introduces a versatile 3D model viewer and renderer built using OpenGL and Assimp. The application supports multiple 3D file formats, provides real-time transformations such as rotation, scaling, and translation, and is designed for cross-platform compatibility. The work includes a detailed performance evaluation to ensure robustness and scalability under various conditions, offering a reliable and interactive visualization tool for static 3D models.
